            Hi, I&apos;m Linus, a #highfive Software Engineering student at
            CODE!
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            My goal with this app is to provide some sense of direction to the
            very free-form learning experience at CODE, and to give students an
            overview about where they&apos;re at in their studies. I&apos;ll add
            more features in the future (star reviews for modules anyone? ðŸ‘€),
            so stay tuned ðŸ¤™

          <Paragraph>
            Study Planner is in no way officially associated with CODE, I&apos;m
            the only one working on it. This means that even though I do my best
            to give you good advice, I don&apos;t take any responsibility for
            inaccurate information. You should always reference official
            resources before making important decisions regarding your studies.
