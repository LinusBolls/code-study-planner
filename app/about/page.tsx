          Hi, I&apos;m Linus, a #highfive Software Engineering student at CODE!
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          My goal with this app is to provide some sense of direction to the
          very free-form learning experience at CODE, and to give students an
          overview about where they&apos;re at in their studies. I&apos;ll add
          more features in the future (star reviews for modules anyone? ðŸ‘€), so
          stay tuned ðŸ¤™

          Study Planner is in no way officially associated with CODE, I&apos;m
          the only one working on it. This means that even though I do my best
          to give you good advice, I don&apos;t take any responsibility for
          inaccurate information. You should always reference official resources
          before making important decisions regarding your studies.
