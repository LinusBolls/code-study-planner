          When you sign into Study Planner using Google SSO or a bearer token,
          we use the same authentication mechanism as the Learning Platform.
          <br />
          This means that we &quot;create a session for you&quot; with the LP
          servers. Using a token created by the LP servers, we communicate with
          them both from your browser and from our own servers. This token gives
          us unrestricted access to your LP account and doesn&apos;t get stored
          on our servers.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We never modify any of your data stored by the Learning Platform, we
          just access it. This may change in the future as we expand the scope
          of Study Planner to allow users to e.g. sign up for modules and
          assessments.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Requests we make from your browser to the LP servers get proxied over
          our own servers. This means that we have temporary access to all data
          the Study Planner requests from the LP as the data passes through our
          servers. Most of this data doesn&apos;t get permanently stored.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Data we request from the LP in your name and have <b>temporary</b>{" "}
          access to includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Your LP authentication token</li>
            <li>Your LP profile, including your full name and email</li>

          </ul>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Data we <b>permanently</b> store in our database includes:

              Your user id for the Learning Platform. This can be linked back to
              your LP profile.
